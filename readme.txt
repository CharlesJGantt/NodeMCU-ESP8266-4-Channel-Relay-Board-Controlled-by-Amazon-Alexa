This code will create four FauxMo smart-home devices that emulate Belkin We-Mo switches. The unmodified version of this code is originally by kakopappa and can be found at https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-alexa-multiple-wemo-switch/tree/master/wemos.

The five additional files: CallbackFunction.h, Switch.cpp, Switch.h, UpnpBroadcastResponder.cpp, and UpnpBroadcastResponder.h are required for the NODEMCU_ALEXA_wemos.ino file to complie and upload to your NodeMCU or ESP8266. 

For more information on how to install the requsite ESP8266 libraries and boards to Arduino, please read my documentation which is part of my LinkNodeR4 and Amazon Alexa tutorial article which can be found at: http://themakersworkbench.com/tutorial/how-use-amazon-alexa-control-linknode-r4-esp8266-4-channel-relay-board

Thanks for checking out my project. If you have improvements, or changes that should be made, please feel free to fork or leave a message and I will add a new branch.
